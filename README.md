# SmartWaste – AI for Urban Waste Optimization
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
SmartWaste is an AI-based system that predicts waste container fill levels and optimizes garbage truck routes to reduce fuel consumption, costs, and emissions.  
Building AI course project.

## Background
Urban waste collection is inefficient because trucks often follow fixed routes regardless of whether containers are full or empty.  
This leads to:
* unnecessary fuel consumption  
* higher pollution  
* increased operational costs  
* traffic congestion  

I chose this topic because sustainability and smart cities are becoming increasingly important, and AI can significantly help reduce environmental impact.

## How is it used?
Municipal waste services or private companies install sensors in waste containers that send fill-level data.  
The AI uses these data to:
* predict when each container will be full  
* suggest optimal pickup schedules  
* generate fuel-efficient truck routes  

Users:
* waste-management operators  
* city administrations  
* logistics planners
